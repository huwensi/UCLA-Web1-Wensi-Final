    <h2>Q1. Explain the difference between HTML, CSS and JS</h2>
    <h3>Html is stands for hypertext markup language. It a well standardizaed 
        system that used for tagging text files to achieve color,graphic, font 
        and effects on web pages.

    <h3>Css is cascading style sheet language that used to handle the presentation of
        the web page containing HTML.(whihc means separates style information from
        web content) Css can make visual effcts and animation on the website
        
</h3>
<h3>JavaScript is a high-level dynamic interpreted programning. It's a 
    scripting language based on Object and EventDriven. The purpose of using 
    it is to link multiole object in web page toghther with HTML hypertext 
    markup language and Java script language to interact with web user.

        JS. We can think of the web as a human body. Html as bones and musclesl,
        Css as kink and hair, and JS as a behabior governed to a certain extent.
