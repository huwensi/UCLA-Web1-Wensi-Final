        <h1>My Homework</h1>
        
    <h2>Q1. Explain the difference between HTML, CSS and JS</h2>
    <h3>Html is stands for hypertext markup language. It a well standardizaed 
        system that used for tagging text files to achieve color,graphic, font 
        and effects on web pages.
           
    </h3>
        <h3>Css is cascading style sheet language that used to handle the presentation of
        the web page containing HTML.(whihc means separates style information from
        web content) Css can make visual effcts and animation on the website
        
        </h3>
         <h3>JavaScript is a high-level dynamic interpreted programning. It's a 
         scripting language based on Object and EventDriven. The purpose of using 
         it is to link multiole object in web page toghther with HTML hypertext 
         markup language and Java script language to interact with web user.
</h3>
        <h3>To help us better understand the relationship between the Html, Css, and
        JS. We can think of the web as a human body. Html as bones and musclesl,
        Css as Skin and hair, and JS as a behabior governed to a certain extent.
        This my not be entirely appropriate, but us better understand.</h3>

            from traditional multi-page Web Sites?</h2>
        
        <h2>SAP is a single page where a lot of information stays the same 
            and only a few pieces need to be updated at a time.
        Stay all on one page- reallu puts the burden/control on JS</h2>

        <h3> The SPA only sends what you need with each click, and your 
            browser renders that information. This is different to a 
            traditional page load where the server re-renders a full 
            page with every click you make and sends it to your browser.</h3>
